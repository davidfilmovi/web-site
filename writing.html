              <h2>On Dragon Hunt and Mutual Transformability</h2>
              <p>
                Taking Samuel Delany’s SciFi novel ‘Stars In My Pocket Like
                Grains of Sand’ as a point of departure, in a joint effort with
                other artists we’ve labored a work which is at once a dance,
                fantasy, and a queer road film. Its protagonists, animated by
                the weirdening landscape of the Dalmatian Hinterland and
                enraptured by the sound of the conch shell, partake in the
                melding tradition of Dragon Hunting. An exploration in somatics,
                media translation, mimicry, and the sensuous, Dragon Hunt is a
                result of mutual transformability exercised between fellow
                artist friends and different machine learning algorithms.

                Transformation not as a means to produce a novel identity –
                readable by the other – but rather transformation as an

                The fact is I find myself now as many other nights on the
                threshold of times, right on the edge where, truly, it often
                gets hard to tell if we belong inside or outside the time we’re
                facing.

              <h2>Opaque Temporary Agency</h2>
              <p>
                This text tries to assemble my current thoughts on the space
                oddities known as Black Holes and how they relate to my artistic
                thinking, interests and practices, dancing between the fields of
                choreography, animation, somatics and SciFy.

                When I move in intentional ways, or rather when I intend to move
                for you, or move in this work, with this task, I am
                approximating a type of movement pattern, a shape in spacetime.

                What affects appear in the rhythm in which I, hunched
                animatorbody, without concrete physical skill or discipline
                attempt to quickly move and stop. How does that movement relate
                to the clumsy animations of Andy’s dance?

              <h2>
                Digital Golem, Gesticulating Hybrids, Affective Clones &
                whatever they want
              </h2>
              <p>
                Puzzled by the idea that images might want something (as
                suggested by WJT Mitchell, 2005) I started exploring possible
                modes of relating to digital images through a performative
                frame. This became ‘Digital Golem, Gesticulating Hybrids,
                Affective Clones and Whatever They Want’, a body of artistic
                processes that took shape back in 2018, during my studies in New
                Media at the Academy of Fine Arts in Zagreb.Presented here is a
                text which served as a companion peace to ‘a performing site for
                affective clones & whatever they want’. Wanting to invert the
                (dominant) Gestalt of the animated figure, a specific type of
                digital image, the text maps the processes of imagemaking,
                animation, choreography and somatics.
